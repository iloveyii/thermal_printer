# Install Thermal Printer

* I used this guide to install an Xprinter on my ubuntu 20.04. I had to change only pos-80 to XP-80 in the instructions of the video.
* If the web admin page asks for login just provide your Linux username(with root or sudo privileges) and password.
* To cut paper see the settings in cut_paper.png.
