# Install Thermal Printer

* I used this guide to install an Xprinter on my ubuntu 20.04. I had to change only pos-80 to XP-80 in the instructions of the video.
* If the web admin page asks for login just provide your Linux username(with root or sudo privileges) and password.



## Drivers link
 * [Drivers](https://www.xprintertech.com/for-windows)
 * I downloaded `80 mm Receipt Printer Drivers for Linux `
